# Simpleproj-Receipts
A simple project that came from just seeing the easily manipulated data of receipts that come by mail. Remade repo due to potentially sensitive data.

Program that goes through email receipts from Hemk√∂p and then writes that to Excel. 

The goal of the program is to create an excel file with 3 columns: time of purchase, item, price. That data is then usable for Excels pivot tables.
